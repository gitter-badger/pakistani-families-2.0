This is to document different aspects of upbringing which are extremely important to be considered by parents of today. I would try to get opinion from newly weds (preferrably millenials), parents of kids from varying ages and parents from our upper generation. The idea is to collect various points focusing on where our parents failed, what are their & our regrets and how generation Y envision upbringing in this era.
