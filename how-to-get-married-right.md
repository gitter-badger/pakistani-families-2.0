This can act as a manual for those who are considering to get married or planning at least. This should give an idea of what are the myths, miconceptions, false information and missing information which either our parents don't share or our society wrongly manifests. I would also like to focus on the 'process' of getting married starting from rishta phase to actual event. How we can do it right!
